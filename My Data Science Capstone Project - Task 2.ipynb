However, recently Google started charging for their API: http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/, so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html.\n\n#### The problem with this Package is you have to be persistent sometimes in order to get the geographical coordinates of a given postal code. So you can make a call to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given postal code and the result would be None, and then make the call again and you would get the coordinates. So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code. Taking postal code M5G as an example, your code would look something like this:",
